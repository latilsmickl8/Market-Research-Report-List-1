<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Therapeutic Enzymes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injectable</li><li>Oral</li><li>Topical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The therapeutic enzymes market is categorized into three types based on administration routes: injectable, oral, and topical. Injectable enzymes are delivered directly into the bloodstream for rapid effects, commonly used for conditions requiring immediate action. Oral enzymes are taken in pill form, offering convenience for chronic conditions but may have slower absorption. Topical enzymes are applied directly to the skin, targeting localized issues like wounds or inflammation. Each form serves distinct therapeutic needs and patient preferences in treatment strategies.</p></p>
